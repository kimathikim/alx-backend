Caching is a technique used in software development to improve performance by storing frequently accessed data in a temporary storage area. This temporary storage, known as a cache, allows subsequent requests for the same data to be served faster, as it eliminates the need to retrieve the data from the original source.

Caching can be implemented at various levels in an application, such as at the database level, the server level, or even at the client level. It can be used to cache database query results, web page content, API responses, or any other data that is expensive to compute or retrieve.

By caching frequently accessed data, applications can reduce the load on the underlying resources, improve response times, and enhance overall system performance. However, caching introduces the challenge of keeping the cache synchronized with the original data source to ensure data consistency.

In addition to improving performance, caching can also be used to store temporary data or to implement features like session management or rate limiting.

In this code, caching is used to store previously computed results of a function to avoid recomputation. The cache is implemented as a dictionary, where the function arguments are used as keys and the corresponding results are stored as values. Before computing the result, the function checks if it is already present in the cache. If so, it retrieves the result from the cache instead of recomputing it.

Note: Caching is a powerful technique, but it should be used judiciously. Care should be taken to invalidate or update the cache when the underlying data changes to ensure data integrity.
